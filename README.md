Hey Guys this is my first time to make a python game, I have learnt Python for a few weeks.
I want to express gratitude to those programmers who pays a lot of effort in programming. Y'all are great and legendary.
For whom it may concern:
  Cai Xukun, as known as Bro Chicken, is famous for being in funny videos made by his "fans". Kun in Chinese can be considered as same as the word "Chicken" presently among Gen Z in China. That's what makes me create this game.
If there is any problem, I hope to get your correction and learn a valuable lesson from you. Thank you for playing my game.
